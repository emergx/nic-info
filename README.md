***1. Cellular Automata:***

A cellular automaton is a dynamical system consisting of an array of cells. Space and time are discrete and each of the cells can be in a finite number of states. The cellular automaton updates the states of its cells synchronously according to the transition rules given a priori. The next state of a cell is computed by a transition rule and it depends only on its current state and the states of its neighbors.

Conway's Game of Life is one of the best-known examples of cellular automata, shown to be computationally universal. Cellular automata have been applied to modelling a variety of phenomena such as communication, growth, reproduction, competition, evolution and other physical and biological processes.

***2. Neural Computation: Self Organizing Map :***

Neural computation is the field of research that emerged from the comparison between computing machines and the human nervous system. This field aims both to understand how the brain of living organisms works (brain theory or computational neuroscience), and to design efficient algorithms based on the principles of how the human brain processes information (Artificial Neural Networks, ANN).[Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)





***3. Evolutionary Computation: Genetic Algorithm :***

Evolutionary computation is a computational paradigm inspired by Darwinian evolution. An artificial evolutionary system is a computational system based on the notion of simulated evolution. It comprises a constant- or variable-size population of individuals, a fitness criterion, and genetically inspired operators that produce the next generation from the current one. The initial population is typically generated randomly or heuristically, and typical operators are mutation and recombination. At each step, the individuals are evaluated according to the given fitness function (survival of the fittest). The next generation is obtained from selected individuals (parents) by using genetically inspired operators. The choice of parents can be guided by a selection operator which reflects the biological principle of mate selection. This process of simulated evolution eventually converges towards a nearly optimal population of individuals, from the point of view of the fitness function.

***4. Swarm Intelligence :***

Swarm intelligence, sometimes referred to as collective intelligence, is defined as the problem solving behavior that emerges from the interaction of individual agents (e.g., bacteria, ants, termites, bees, spiders, fish, birds) which communicate with other agents by acting on their local environments.

Particle swarm optimization applies this idea to the problem of finding an optimal solution to a given problem by a search through a (multi-dimensional) solution space. The initial set-up is a swarm of particles, each representing a possible solution to the problem. Each particle has its own velocity which depends on its previous velocity (the inertia component), the tendency towards the past personal best position (the nostalgia component), and its tendency towards a global neighborhood optimum or local neighborhood optimum (the social component). Particles thus move through a multidimensional space and eventually converge towards a point between the global best and their personal best. Particle swarm optimization algorithms have been applied to various optimization problems, and to unsupervised learning, game learning, and scheduling applications.[Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence)





***5. Artificial Immune Systems :***

Artificial immune systems (a.k.a. immunological computation or immunocomputing) are computational systems inspired by the natural immune systems of biological organisms.

Viewed as an information processing system, the natural immune system of organisms performs many complex tasks in parallel and distributed computing fashion. These include distinguishing between self and nonself,[19] neutralization of nonself pathogens (viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites), learning, memory, associative retrieval, self-regulation, and fault-tolerance. Artificial immune systems are abstractions of the natural immune system, emphasizing these computational aspects. Their applications include computer virus detection, anomaly detection in a time series of data, fault diagnosis, pattern recognition, machine learning, bioinformatics, optimization, robotics and control.
